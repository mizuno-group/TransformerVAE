# TransformerVAE
This document describes the codes used in the paper and how to replicate the result.

## Environment
The following packages are required. Note that the latest versions have now possibly become incompatible with our codes, and older versions in these ranges may work.
- python>=3.7
- numpy>=1.21
- pandas>=1.2
- tqdm>=4.63
- addict>=2.4
- rdkit==2023.03
- PyTorch==1.12

You can build a conda environment using [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) except PyTorch like the following commands. For PyTorch package, please install the proper version according to your GPU environment.
```sh
conda create -n transformervae python==3.7
conda activate transformervae
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data preprocessing for training
To train the model with SMILES dataset, you first need to canonicalize and randomize SMILES and then tokenize them.   
```
python preprocess.py --processname <processed data name> --data path_to_smiles_data.txt
```
- ```<processed data name>``` can be an arbitrary string. Processed data will be stored in ```./preprocess/results/<processed data name>```.
- Input SMILES file ("*path_to_smiles_data.txt*") must contain one SMILES string in each row without header.  
- You have to process train and validation data for training.

## Training
Transformer VAE model can be trained by the processed random/canonical SMILES
```
python train.py --name example --train_data <processed train data name> --val_data <processed validation data name>
```

## Trained model weights
Trained model weight can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nAWJpFPSsnd_y3nE7xHWcdSgA64WX5Je&usp=drive_fs).  
Currently, the following models are available:
- moses: Fully trained model trained by [MOSES](https://github.com/molecularsets/moses) dataset.
- zinc: Fully trained model trained by [ZINC-15](https://zinc15.docking.org/) dataset.  

Weights of each module in the model is stored separetely in the above directories.

## Featurization
You can get estimated mean of posterior distribution of latent variables as descriptor of molecules using ```featurize.py```
```
python featurize.py --data <processed data name> -- path_to_model_weight_dir --name <feature name>
```
- ```<feature name>``` can be an arbitrary string. Feature is stored in ```./featurization/results/<feature name>/feature.csv```. This files contains feature of each molecule in each row without index column (A header row exists).

## Molecule generation
Molecules can be generated by your trained or downloaded model.
```
python generation/generate.py --weight path_to_model_weight_dir --n 30000 --name <generation name>
```
- Generated molecules will be stored in ```generation/results/<generation name>/smiles.txt```


## Decode molecule from feature
Molecules can be decoded from arbitrary latent variables using ```decode.py```.
```
python decode.py --latent path_to_latent_variables --weight path_to_model_weight_dir --name <decoding name>
```
- Latent variables must be prepared in a csv format. Each row has to contain latent variables of one molecule without index columns (A header row has to exist). A feature file made in ```featurization.py``` satisfies the format. 
- ```<decoding name>``` can be an arbitrary string. Decoded SMILES are stored in ```./decoding/results/<decoding name>/decoded_smiles.txt```. This file contains SMILES of each molecule without header.
